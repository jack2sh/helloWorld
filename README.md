##《Battery Model Parameter Estimation Using a Layered Technique: An Example Using a Lithium Iron Phosphate Cell》##
**电池模型参数预测**
> This challenge is addressed using a layered approach to break
the parameter estimation problem into smaller tasks. The size
of each estimation task is reduced to a small subset of data and
parameter values, so that the optimizer can better focus on a
specific problem. The layered approach was successful in
fitting an equivalent circuit model to a lithium iron phosphate
(LFP) cell data set to within a mean of 0.7mV residual error,
and max of 9.2mV error at a transient
